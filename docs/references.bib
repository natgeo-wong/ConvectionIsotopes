   abstract = {<p>The present study explores the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to accurately reproduce the passage of extratropical cold fronts at the DOE ARM eastern North Atlantic (ENA) observation site on the Azores. An analysis of three case studies is performed in which the impact of the WRF domain size, position of the model boundary relative to the ENA site, grid spacing, and spectral nudging conditions are explored. The results from these case studies indicate that model biases in the timing and duration of cold front passages change with the distance between the model domain boundary and the ENA site. For these three cases, if the western model boundary is farther than 1500 km from the site, the front becomes too meridional and fails to reach the site, making 1000 or 1500 km the optimal distances. In contrast, integrations with small distances (e.g., 500 km) between the site and domain boundaries have inadequate spatial spinup (i.e., the domain is too small for the model to properly stabilize). For all three cases, regardless of domain size, the model has biases in its upper-level circulation that impact the position and timing of the front. However, this issue is most serious for 4000-km2 domains and larger. For these domains, prolonged spectral nudging can correct cold front biases. As such, this analysis provides a framework to optimize the WRF Model configuration necessary for a realistic hindcast of a cold front passage at a fixed location centered in a domain as large as computationally possible.</p>},

   abstract = {A high-resolution regional atmospheric model is employed to project the late twenty-first-century changes of tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WP) and southwest Pacific (SP). The model realistically reproduces the basic features of the TC climatology in the present-day simulation. Future projections under the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP45) and 8.5 (RCP85) scenarios are investigated. The results show no significant change of TC genesis frequency (TCGF) in the WP by RCP45 due to the cancellation of the reduction over the western part and the increase over the eastern part together with a considerable decrease of TCGF by RCP85 due to the excessive TCGF reduction in the western part. The TCGF over the SP consistently decreases from RCP45 to RCP85. Despite the fact that the simulated maximum surface wind speeds are below 52 m s <sup>−1</sup> , the change with more strong TCs and fewer weak TCs is robust. The future changes in the TC genesis locations and translational speeds modulate the TC lifetime and frequency of occurrence. The TC genesis potential index (GPI) is used to evaluate the projected TCGF changes. The results show that low-level vorticity and midtropospheric vertical velocity largely contribute to the reduction of GPI in the western part of the WP, while vertical wind shear and midtropospheric vertical velocity mainly contribute to the decrease of GPI over the SP. The weakening of the monsoon trough is found to be responsible for the decreases of GPI and TCGF over the western part of the WP.},
